An AI-powered translation app that can automatically identify the language of the input text and provide not only the translation but also alternatives and dialogue examples that can cater to a broad set of needs and solve several issues that users commonly face.

## Features
### Automatic Language Detection
Users are relieved of the hassle of specifying the language they are translating from, making the translation process quicker and more seamless.

### Context-Aware Translations
By providing alternatives and examples, users can understand the subtleties and nuances of translated phrases, enabling more accurate and contextually appropriate translations.

### Learning and Enhancement
Language learners can benefit significantly as they get to see the phrases in various contexts, helping them understand the practical usage of words and phrases, and enhancing their language learning journey.

### Conversation Simulation
By providing dialogue examples, the app can simulate real-life conversations, helping users construct sentences correctly and understand how different phrases are used in conversations.

## Quick Start
* Input your ***OpenAI API Key*** in the sidebar and select the target language(5 different language limited to [gtts](https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) text-to-speech package capability).
* Input the context to translate.
* Check the result, alternatives, and examples and listen to the audio.

## Constraints
AI may detect the target language incorrectly, and try multiple times to get the right answer.
